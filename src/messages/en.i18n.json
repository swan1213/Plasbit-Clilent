New regulations provide more pressure. There’s never been a better time to be a part of the evolution blockchain technology. ",

These individuals have little to no ability to push peacefully for reform concerning economic problems such as state corruption, currency debasement, and financial surveillance. Cash is a vital tool of savings and privacy for them. Once it is gone, the nature of whatever replaces it will, in no small way, dictate their freedom. ",

        "Popular crypto exchange Coinbase recently acquired wallet company BRD. We've compared the PlasBit Wallet with the BRD and Coinbase Wallets to help you decide which crypto wallet is right for you and your digital assets.",
        "PlasBit Wallet Overview",
        "The PlasBit Wallet is a free crypto wallet</a> with best_in_class security features like 2 factor authentication, pin code, biometric security, and a 12 word seed phrase back up. Integrate multiple wallets like Metamask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase all in one app. Available as a  mobile or desktop app, our wallet is non_custodial. This means that you, and only you, own your keys. Spend crypto with the PlasBit Card</a> (free virtual card) and buy gift cards</a> right in the app or Extension</a>. Buy and swap all of your favorite coins. PlasBit integrates with 1inch, a DEX aggregator dedicated to finding the best crypto prices on the most popular cryptocurrencies. An intuitive, simple design allows crypto pros and novices alike to take control of their assets with ease.",
        "Bottom Line: ",
        "The PlasBit Wallet is a great option for seasoned crypto enthusiasts as well as beginners. It's features make it ideal if you want to manage assets across multiple wallets (especially Coinbase Exchange's custodial wallet) and spend crypto or convert crypto to cash without selling on an exchange.",
        "The only crypto wallet app you need to take control of your assets.",
        "Get the App",
        "BRD Wallet Overview",
        "BRD is a non_custodial mobile wallet that lets you buy, store, sell, swap, and stake crypto. BRD is available on mobile for iOS and Android platforms and includes several security features like pin code, biometric security, and a 12 word seed phrase. It's simple design will please even complete beginners. BRD's centralized exchange allows users to buy, sell, and swap a large variety of popular coins and altcoins. However, BRD doesn't offer a connected debit card to spend crypto gains or the ability to buy gift cards within the app. &nbsp;Unlike PlasBit and Coinbase wallets, you may not connect any multiple wallets within the app to manage all of your assets in one place.",
        "Bottom Line: ",
        "The BRD wallet's simple design and industry_standard security features make it a reasonable option for crypto beginners that want to dabble in a variety of coins and tokens without any accounts, logins, or KYC.",
        "Coinbase Wallet Overview",
        "The Coinbase Wallet is a non_custodial crypto wallet. It is separate from the Coinbase Exchange where you may buy, sell, and exchange crypto. It offers users the ability to buy, store, and exchange an impressive amount of digital assets including cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs. You have the option to connect your Coinbase Wallet and buy/sell/transfer coins through the Coinbase's centralized exchange (with fees applied) or browse a number of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and others. Similar to the PlasBit Wallet, you may connect multiple wallets in the app. The Coinbase debit card is currently on a waitlist, leaving no way to spend crypto directly from the Coinbase Wallet app.",
        "Bottom Line: ",
        "The Coinbase Wallet can be good for users that want to explore the expansive  decentralized web for niche digital assets."
